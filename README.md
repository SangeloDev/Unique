# Unique
**Escape the ordinary â€“ Be Unique!**

This Plugin for Paper and Spigot aims to do what Essentials and others have tried, but in my opinion haven't achieved: Make the use of the plugin as user-friendly as possible. The user should know from a simple description what a command does, how to set it's permissions up and how to use it by reading a simple to understand [WIP] wiki page.
